HTTP GET request example
	- http://localhost:8080/Capture_Server/Resolver?a=sds&b=sad&c=cat&c=dog&one=two
		a   = "sds"
		b   = "sad"
		c   = {"cat","dog"}
		one = "two"

	- All these parameters go in the header of the request. Must not try to put it in the body even though it is possible.
	  It is against the convention
	  Resolved in the server with the following code
	  Map<String, String[]> parameters =request.getParameterMap();
		System.out.println(parameters.get("c")[1]);
		System.out.println(parameters.get("c")[0]);
