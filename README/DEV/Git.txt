Git ignore file: 
	create a file named .gitignore 
	List all the files/folders you want to ignore in the .gitignore file
	do git rm -r --cached <filename> to force remove them
	commit the .gitignore file as well


Git force commit disregarding old head [DO NOT DO THIS UNLES YOU ARE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY EXTREMEY SURE]
	Do this only if git is confused. And you are sure you are not. (I did this once, and spent an hour fixing the mess)
	> git push -f origin master

Git force pull REPLACING local files
	Will completely replace local files and bring local code to the head of the repo
	> git fetch --all
	> git reset --hard origin/master
