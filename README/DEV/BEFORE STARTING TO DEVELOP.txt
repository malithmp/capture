IMPORTANT!!
if you are using an inferior operating system like Linux or Windows [infact anything that is not MacOSX] then you might need to manually add some libraries to make websockets work. To do this
	- Right click on project->properties->Java Build Path -> Libraries[3rd tab] -> Add external Jars
	- Then navigate to apache directory-> lib
	- Select all the libraries and hit ok

	- OR you can do this by 2 easy steps
		- Go to a mac store
		- Buy a mac
